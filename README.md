# Agent Skills for WordPress

**Teach AI coding assistants how to build WordPress the right way.**

Agent Skills are portable bundles of instructions, checklists, and scripts that help AI assistants (Claude, Copilot, Codex, Cursor, etc.) understand WordPress development patterns, avoid common mistakes, and follow best practices.

> **AI Authorship Disclosure:** The upstream WordPress skills were generated using GPT-5.2 Codex (High Reasoning) from official Gutenberg and WordPress documentation, then reviewed and edited by WordPress contributors. This fork extends that base with additional Dan Knauss and third-party skills for WordPress operations, security, local environment management, and GitHub workflows. See [docs/ai-authorship.md](docs/ai-authorship.md) in upstream for the original disclosure context.

Fork of [WordPress/agent-skills](https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills) with additional skills from [Dan Knauss](https://github.com/dknauss) and other sources.

This is the canonical skill repo for all agent work in my WordPress project environments. Any AI agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Copilot) working on WordPress code or docs pulls skill definitions from this repo of repos.

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they often:
- Generate outdated WordPress patterns (pre-Gutenberg, pre-block themes)
- Miss critical security considerations in plugin development
- Skip proper block deprecations, causing "Invalid block" errors
- Ignore existing tooling in your repo

This fork keeps the upstream WordPress foundation, then layers in repo hygiene, security review, performance review, documentation, and local environment operations skills that I actually use day to day.

## Installation

### Global install for Claude Code

```bash
node shared/scripts/build-dist.sh
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --global
```

Installs to `~/.claude/skills/` where Claude Code discovers them automatically.

### Install into a project

```bash
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --dest=../your-wp-project --targets=codex,vscode,claude,cursor
```

### Other options

```bash
# List available skills
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --list

# Install specific skills only
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --global --skills=wp-playground,wp-block-development

# Global install for Cursor
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --targets=cursor-global

# Global install for Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --global-all

# Dry run
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --global --dry-run
```

### Automatic local sync after repo updates

If you want this repo to refresh installed skills automatically after local commits, pulls, or branch checkouts:

```bash
node shared/scripts/install-auto-sync-hooks.mjs
```

That keeps these user-level installs in sync:

- `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`
- `~/.claude/skills`
- `~/.cursor/skills`

Skill updates become active for those tools on the next new session or task. Existing chats do not hot-reload skills mid-thread.

GitHub Copilot / VS Code skills stay repo-local, not global. If you also want this repo to mirror updated `.github/skills` into specific repos:

```bash
node shared/scripts/install-auto-sync-hooks.mjs --vscode-repos=/abs/path/repo-one,/abs/path/repo-two
```

Recommended operating model for repo-local VS Code / Copilot skills:

- Treat `.github/skills/` as a **local-only mirror** in consumer repos.
- Add `.github/skills/` to your global or local git ignore rules so those mirrors do not show up as product changes.
- Use this repo (`agent-skills`) as the **only** managed source for those mirrors.
- Do not manually copy from other repos such as `skills/.github/skills/`; that creates drift and mixed skill sets.

## Quality Gates

- `node eval/harness/run.mjs` validates skill metadata, compatibility declarations, and required scenario coverage.
- `bash eval/harness/run-scenarios.sh eval/scenarios/` validates scenario file structure.
- `node shared/scripts/build-dist.sh` or `node shared/scripts/skillpack-build.mjs --clean --out=dist --targets=codex,vscode,claude,cursor` verifies distributable skillpacks can be produced.

## Branches

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `trunk` | Default branch with upstream sync plus fork additions |
| Feature branches | PRs, experiments, and fork-only work |
| `upstream/trunk` | Upstream reference branch from WordPress/agent-skills |

## Compatibility

- WordPress 6.9+ (PHP 7.2.24+)
- Works with any AI assistant that supports project-level instructions

## License

GPL-2.0-or-later — same as upstream.
